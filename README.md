# Block6

### Description

Block6 is an SMS application that makes it easy to block text messages from phone numbers. It provides a simple interface with few options, and no ads, in contrast to many of the other SMS apps available.

Block6 is intended mainly for phones running Android versions less than 7.0. It targets Android version 4.4 KitKat (API Level 19) and above. It also works fine on Android 9 Pie.

Android 7.0 introduced better [built-in support](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/connect/block-numbers) for blocking numbers so this app is probably less useful on versions 7+.

### Get It

You can download Block6 from the F-Droid app store [here](https://). Google has recently stopped allowing apps that request SMS permissions onto the Google Play store without going through a lengthy approval process. Most apps still end up rejected after applying for an exception. Check out F-Droid for an alternative to the Google Play store. In addition, all apps on F-Droid are made free by the app developers.

### Open Source

Block6 is free and open source on Github at https://github.com/travistynes/block6. Send feedback, pull requests, or use the code for your own purpose.
